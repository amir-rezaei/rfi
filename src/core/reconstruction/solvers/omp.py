    Solves the L1-regularized problem using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).

    This implementation is designed for the synthesis model where the goal is to
    find a sparse coefficient vector 's' such that y â‰ˆ forward_op(s).
    OMP is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the most correlated
    atom from the dictionary and then projects the signal onto the space
    spanned by the selected atoms.

    Args:
        y: The complex-valued measurement vector.
        s_len: The length of the sparse coefficient vector 's' to be solved for.
        forward_op: The forward operator, e.g., lambda s: A @ D(s).
        adjoint_op: The adjoint of the forward operator, e.g., lambda r: D.T(A.H @ r).
        prox_op: The proximal operator, not used by OMP but included for a consistent solver interface.
        params: A dictionary of parameters containing:
            - 'max_iter' (int): The number of non-zero coefficients to select
                               (the sparsity level k).
            - 'alpha' (float): Regularization strength, used here as a residual
                               threshold for early stopping.

    Returns:
        The reconstructed complex-valued sparse coefficient vector 's'.
